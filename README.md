# Project1

Code a simple PHP web application login form. The login form page should only take a username and password as user input. No user registration required or desired for this application. Below is a simple list of more requirements:

- No JavaScript (5)
- No PHP frameworks (5)
- No 3rd party plugins or libraries (5)
- No database of any type at this time (10)
- Do not embed PHP in HTML (10)
- All page styling has to be done with CSS (5)
- Must support at least two different forms of authentication. For example:
    - In memory database (10)
    - File-based (10)
- Ensure your code this project loosely-coupled (interface/abstract) (10)
- Project runs without errors or warnings using the `webserver` file (20)

This is an individual project, no collaborations with anyone. In other words, it must be your own work.
